# Automatic Crossposter for r/Graz
Stolen from https://github.com/MrEdinLaw/reddit-automaticCrossposter:
A bot that waits for a freely definable post to appear in a subreddit to crosspost it to another subreddit.

I customized this bot to be used on the Graz subreddit to get a little more traction from the posts in r/Austria.
